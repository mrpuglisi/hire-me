# hire-me
Hi there, I’m Rose 🌹

This repo holds the code for my personal resume website. It’s equal parts professional portfolio and a playground for me to mess around with front-end code when I get the itch. As a Product Manager, I spend most of my day thinking about users, products, and strategy. But I also like getting my hands dirty and learning the ins and outs of what we’re building (for example, my personal website was built as a learning exercise). Consider this my way of staying sharp on the job while always giving it my personal twist.🌪️

✨ What’s Inside • An online version of my resume (because PDFs are boring) • A place to share my projects, skills, and background • A design that feels like me (think: clean, welcoming, and a little playful)

🛠️ Tech & Tools • Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript • Version Control: Git + GitHub • Deployment: GitHub Pages
