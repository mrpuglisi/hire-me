        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm MaryRose, but you can just call me Rose. I grew up in the northeast, but one cold morning I realized I wanted something different. So I packed up my car and my family and drove to St. Petersburg, FL to be closer to the ocean and the outdoors. That decision reflects how I approach everything in my life: with intention, clarity, and follow-through.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I'm an open water swimmer, a yoga teacher, and an avid animal lover. I thrive on challenges, whether it's a committed 5 mile swim with potential sharks or gators, or a complex product launch. It's important to me that I bring that energy to every team I join. </p>
        <p>I believe that the best products and communities are built by people who can show up fully.</p>
