      <p>
        Professionally, I love to talk strategy. Tell me your most complex problem, and I’ll find a way to solve it. I love leading teams, and finding ways to improve morale and processes simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m an open water swimmer, a yoga teacher, and an avid animal lover.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive on challenges, whether it’s a new product launch or a committed 5-mile swim with potential sharks or gators. It’s important to me that I bring that energy to every team I join because I believe that the best products and communities are built by people who continue to show up fully.
